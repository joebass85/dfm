## What is dfm?
Dfm is a dmenu-based, no extra dependencies file manager. It seeks to provide a simple, clean interface for your files without all of the heaviness of a traditional GUI file manager.

## How to set up dfm
Run the `dfm-install.sh` script to setup dfm.

## Dependencies
The only dependency needed is `dmenu` (which I consider an essential program, not a dependency).
Every other tool the script uses is supplied by the standard GNU Utilites package, along with your distribution's terminal emulator and a text editor of some sort (be it vim, nano, leafpad, etc.).
